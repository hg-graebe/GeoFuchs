# GeoFuchs

GeoFuchs is a small Java based DGS prototype developed by several of my
students during 2003-2005.

The build process has to be fixed.

The code was formerly hosted at
[SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/geofuchs) and is released under
the GNU GPL 3.0.

# Short description and history

The ''GeoFuchs'' is a small Java based Dynamical Geometry Software (DGS) that
compares in its functionality with other DGS as, e.g., DynaGeo, Cinderella,
Zirkel_und_Lineal, GeoGebra, GeoneXt, Euklid etc.

The project grew out from Malte Witte's GeoViewer and a
[project](http://pcai042.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/swp/SWP-03/geo08/) within
the [SWT-Praktikum
2003](http://pcai042.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/swp/SWP-03/Themen.html).
Special thanks to Marin Todorov, Joachim Bachmann, Thomas Chiarcos, Yves
Metzner, Armin Vollmer and Andrej Aderhold wo composed also the [GeoFuchs
Song](fuxx.mp3).

This work was consolidated and greatly improved by Andy Stock during his
[Bachelor thesis](Documentation/Stock-04.pdf) (until Nov. 2004).
