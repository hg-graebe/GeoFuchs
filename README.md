# GeoFuchs

GeoFuchs is a small Java based DGS prototype developed by several of my
students during 2003-2005.

The build process has to be fixed.

The code was formerly hosted at
[SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/geofuchs) and is released under
the GNU GPL 3.0.

# Short description and history

The *GeoFuchs* is a small Java based Dynamical Geometry Software (DGS). It is a
proof of concept and prototypical implementation of functionality that is
offered by other DGS as, e.g., DynaGeo, Cinderella, Zirkel und Lineal,
GeoGebra, GeoneXt, Euklid etc., in much more complexity.

The project grew out from Malte Witte's GeoViewer and a
[project](http://pcai042.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/swp/SWP-03/geo08/) within
the [SWT-Praktikum
2003](http://pcai042.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/swp/SWP-03/Themen.html).
Special thanks to Marin Todorov, Joachim Bachmann, Thomas Chiarcos, Yves
Metzner, Armin Vollmer and Andrej Aderhold wo composed also the [GeoFuchs
Song](fuxx.mp3).

This work was consolidated and greatly improved by Andy Stock during his
[Bachelor thesis](Documentation/Stock-04.pdf) (until Nov. 2004).
